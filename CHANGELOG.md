# Changelog

Notable changes to FlagonQuest, newest first. Each entry is a summary — see
`git log` for the full commit-by-commit detail behind any of these.

## 2026-08-04 — Health tracking

- Character Sheet's Health box now tracks current Shallow/Deep Health, not
  just the max: a heart-pip readout you can click directly, plus a
  −/+ stepper for one-at-a-time changes.
- Hitting 0 Shallow Health auto-flags **Wounded**: a badge on the Health
  box, an automatic −2 applied to Speed and all five Defenses (called out
  in red on each), and a reminder to also apply Bad Luck to flips by hand.

## 2026-08-03 — Character management, flavor text, content sources

- **Duplicate** a character into a new slot; **Backup/Restore all**
  characters at once (everything lives in browser storage only, so this is
  the only way to back up more than one at a time).
- Removing a technique or item now shows a brief "Removed X — Undo" toast.
- Restored the full original flavor text for 66 techniques that had been
  condensed down to a single line somewhere before this repo's history —
  cross-checked against the source content document.
- **Sources** panel on the Builder tab: toggle which supplements (Base
  Game, Goblin Game) show up when picking new content, without touching
  anything already in a build.
- Un-stuck the header bar (scrolls away normally instead of staying
  pinned); Rulebook/Glossary nav links now wrap together as a pair.

## 2026-08-02 — Goblin Game content, combat math, item filters

- 14 new Goblin Game clan Backgrounds (Bloody Banner, Rockbiters,
  Black-Ear, Dampfoot, Firebug, Fardown, Troll-Food); Backgrounds and
  Techniques sections are drag-reorderable on the Character Sheet.
- Advanced filters on the Items tab (Slot, keyword, Supplement);
  Techniques default-sorted by Level then name.
- Permanent max-Health bonuses from techniques (Toughened Body/Resolve/
  Spirit) now flow through to the sheet automatically.
- Accuracy/Defenses/Reflex consistently use Skill **Total** (stat + skill
  points), not just the raw skill value; Unarmed requires a free hand.
- Custom weapon builder for freeform items; Goblin Game firearms and bomb
  variants added.
- Auto-calculated Parry Defense and weapon damage; dual-mode Thrown
  weapons (melee + thrown stats together); drag-reorder inventory.
- Masterwork base-item picker with per-level pricing; custom items with
  their own stats and stacked powers.

## 2026-08-01 — Items, Backgrounds, multiple characters

- Items and Backgrounds pickers added, with equip/parry tracking.
- Character **slots** — the browser can hold more than one character, with
  a switcher in the header.
- Print layout overhaul: compact header box, pinned footer, alternating
  row shading that actually survives most browsers' print settings.

## 2026-07-29 – 2026-07-31 — Foundation

- Initial build-out: technique browser and search, the Builder/Character
  Sheet split, Stats & Skills point-buy with XP budget, Feature-built
  techniques (Battle Maneuvers, Spells, etc.) with their point budgets,
  share links, the Rulebook and Glossary pages, and the site's branding
  and print styling.
